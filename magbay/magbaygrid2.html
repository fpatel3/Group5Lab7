            <h2>Chocolate Hills, Bohol</h2>
            <p class="itemdescription">The Chocolate Hills in the province of Bohol is a natural geological phenomenon of which there are few examples in the world and a definite must-see when in the Philippines. In this very unusual landscape, and in an area of just over thirty square miles, there is mound after mound of karst hills. 
                The cone-shaped bumps, some over a hundred and fifty feet high, blanket the ground wherever you look. The number of hills has never been ascertained, but is well over a thousand and could be closer to two. 
                Covered in grass during the wet season, when the climate changes and the grass dries out, the hills take on a distinct dark brown coloration from which they take their name.

            <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces</h2>
            <p class="itemdescription">The rice terraces were constructed more than two thousand years ago by the indigenous inhabitants of Luzon and rise, tier upon tier, up the mountain sides to a staggering five-thousand feet. 
                Which, considering there was no agricultural machinery in that era, and the terraces were constructed by hand, is an incredible feat. 
                The Banaue terraces are part of the extensive spread of Ifugao rice paddies which also include similar fields at Batad, Bangaan, Mayoyao, Kiangan, and Hungduan and a must-see when in the Philippines.
